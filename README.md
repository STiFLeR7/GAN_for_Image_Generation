# GAN for Image Generation

![Header Image](path/to/your/header-image.png)

This repository contains code and resources for generating images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`GAN_For_Image_Generation.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a GAN for creating synthetic images.


## Introduction

![Example Image](path/to/your/example-image.png)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/STiFLeR7/GAN_For_Image_Generation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd GAN_For_Image_Generation
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook GAN_For_Image_Generation.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the GAN and generate images.
